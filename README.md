# SETUP and RUN PROJECT

1. Open terminal and type `npm install or npm i`
2. In the terminal type command "npm run wdio"

Also, i have faced a follow problem. Modal window(pop-up), doesn't appear at all. (Possible "Black Friday" action is over)
I wrote a some code for this scenario, but i use comments, to avoid crash my project
